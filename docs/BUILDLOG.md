# Build Log

Loop discipline: **build → test → fix → document → commit**. One entry per iteration.

## Iteration 0 — scaffold
- Cloned empty repo, laid package skeleton, README, ARCHITECTURE, pyproject.
- Environment: Python 3.13.9, pytest 8.4.2, zero runtime deps (stdlib only).
- Decision: MockBackend simulates constraint-induced corruption via a per-field
  corruption table applied only under `force_json=True` — gives tests exact ground
  truth about which fields are corrupted, so detector recall/precision are directly
  assertable.
